# fault-detection
This project aims to detect faults in high-voltage transmission lines using MATLAB and Simulink. Transmission line faults, such as short circuits and ground faults, can cause power disruptions. This system identifies and classifies these faults in real-time, enabling quick corrective actions to maintain grid stability.
